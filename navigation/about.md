## Hobbies 
Music has always been a huge part of my life, as I have been playing piano ever since I was 8 years old. Unfortunately, 

my piano teacher died, and I had to quit.

Afer quitting piano, I switched to an instrument called Veena! Can you guess where this instrument is from based on the image below?

## Born
 Tamil Nadu, India!
- Moved to *San Diego* at age 5
- Since I was so young when we moved, I don't really have any memories of India, but I've always loved the food and being around my cousins!


Here are some pictures of my life while living in India:
