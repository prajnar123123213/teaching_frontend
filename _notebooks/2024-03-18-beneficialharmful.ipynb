    "<h3> Automated telephone trees </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an example from CollegeBoard: An automated telephone tree is what companies use to redirect you based on your needs. (For ex: \"Press 1 if you need assistance, Press 2 if it's an emergency, etc)\n",
    "- This innovation allowed for empolyers to save money and for a reduction in hold time for consumers, leading to an overall beneficial effect. \n",

    "<h3> Science and Technology </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computing has allowed for new technologies like MRI scanning and DNA sequencing. \n",
    "- This allows for scientists to develop new medicines and ways to diagnose diseases efficiantly. Technological advancments were also the only reason people were able to develop vaccines for diseases like COVID, allowing for peace within a society. \n",
    "<img width=\"280\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5338e2c-54e3-4c82-98ae-5433277da98f\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Access to Education </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technology has allowed for things like encyclopedias to be transferred online and education artices to be published in online databases. Libraries also have a large collection of e-books, allowing for a wide variety of information readily avaialable to everyone. \n",
    "- Google and other browesers have made it possible to have millions of sources at our fingertips. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3> Digital Divide</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technology can often be expensive and inaccesable to those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Many people living in rural parts of America go their entire life without having their own computers or very limited access to any form of technology. \n",
    "    - Leads to harmful effects of inequality: during the pandemic, many children did not have access to online schooling due to the digital divide \n",
    "- Advancements in technology can also lead to more censorship from conservative governments, causing digital divide. For example, China has a lot of censorship on internet material that the United States does not restrict. (Gmail, Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and more). \n",
    "<img width=\"573\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c1c965-ab89-4bff-aeb2-1f7b744a103b\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3> Phishing, Cybersecurity Risks </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Older populations like senior citizens are unaware of the many phishing and security breaches that happen when using technology. They are not taught how to avoid and stay safe online, leading to many risks. Voice phishing can lead to loss in money, or even identity theft. \n",
    "    - Younger populations like young children using the internet are also more susceptible to online scams or false advertismemt. \n",
    "- Another big risk in young children is the chance that they might fall prey to inapporpriate content or grooming by adults while using technology. There have been many cases across the country where children have been exploited by pedophiles and other harmful people due to unmonitered technology use.\n",
    "<img width=\"572\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d8f32c6-4cc4-4e3c-93f9-74be74a469bd\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Social Media </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is one of the most talkiged about harmful effects of technology, specifically in teenagers. Social media like Instagram and TikTok have been proven to decrease mental health and cause insecurities in impressionable teenagers. It can also lead to depression or anxiety. \n",
    "    - In 2022 mother Tammy Rodriguez suied media giants like Meta and Snapchat for suposedly driving her 11 year old daughter to suicide. Rodriguez reported that her daugher's hyperfixation on social media would lead her to be violent and sometimes depressed because of poor self-esteem. \n",
    "- Trends and challenges on social media have also made children take many bad decisions. \n",
    "    - Also in 2022, 4 parents sued TikTok after their kids had died while attempting the \"blackout challenge\" together. This challenge was to hold your breath for as long as you can, and the young children were not smart enough to know when to stop.  \n",

    "<h3> Artificial Intelligence </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the developent of AI, there has been a large surge in the use of OpenAI and ChatGPT. The ethics of using AI has consistantly been argued over the last few years. \n",
    "    - Benefits: AI is easy to use and beneficial to students that may need a little help finishing or starting assigments. AI also allows for increased efficiancy and productivity, as answers are given to users in mere seconds. It is also able to analyze large sets of data in seconds, which is much more efficiant for businesses looking to save money. Lastly, AI can also be used in healthcare by monitoring patients and identifiying symptons that may have been missed by humans. \n",
    "    - Harm: AI is known to contribute to global warming; GPT-3 developed by OpenAI used over 700,000 liters of water and generated over 552 tons of carbon dioxide. It is estimated that data centers and artifical intelligence will could consume over 4% of annual global energy usage. Many schools also argue that the use of AI is taking away from students' learning experience and taking away critical thinking skills. AI can also be used to create harmful media like deepfake or manipulative videos that spread misinformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"547\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d3408a-c9b3-4973-8b25-27ee00b57d82\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> UAVs/ Drones </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is another example used by CollegeBoard. UAVs/ Drones are used as a tool for search and rescue, aerial photography, and military purposes. However, many argue that it could violate privacy. \n",
    "    - Benefits: Using drones for search and rescue is much more efficiant that using a helicopter and looking with just your eye. The camera of a drone is much more clear and useful. Drones can also be used for things like wildfire monitoring, ensuring the safety of humans. Drones have also been used for things like Agriculture, allowing for a easier and more cost efficiant way to spread pesticide. \n",
    "    - Harms: Many have expressed privacy concerns, claiming that a camera constantly flying above them is a violation of their security. Unauthorized drones or bad controlling can also lead them to crash into power lines or buildings, causing costly repairs. Using drones for military and war is also controversial, especially after many terrorist attacks. For example, drones attacked Syria on October 2023, leaving 89 people dead and over 200 injured. \n",

    "\n",
    "<h3> Facial Recognition Technology </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facial Recognition identifies users by matching their faces against databases. Over the years, people have brought up the issues of privacy and bias. \n",
    "    - Benefits: Apple's facial recognition (FaceID) has made it easy for users to unlock their phone without having to always type in a password. It is also easy for law and police officers to use to find a criminal that was caught on camera. \n",
    "    - Harms: As it is still a developing technology, it is possiible for it to make erros when identifying a face. This can lead to unfair arrests by law enforcement. In 2023, a woman from Detroit was wrongfully put in jail for many years after she was identified as a suspect by faulty recognition tech. \n",
    "         - Many have also complained about bias regarding facial recognition. In 2019, MIT researches found that facial recongition was trained using only white male faces. Amazon's technology, for example, was unable to identify darker skinned people as even human and would only work when they wore a white mask. This issue was taken to court, where Representative AOC ruled that algorithms can be racist. \n",
