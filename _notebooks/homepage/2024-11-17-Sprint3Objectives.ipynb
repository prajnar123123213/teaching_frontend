    "- Voting room! Here, students can vote on drawings that they think look better, and we can choose weekly winners. \n",
    "- Chat room! Students are able to upload pictures of their drawing and have discussion about their artwork. They can also switch to different chats and have conversations with more than one person. \n",
    "- Drawing Post! This is the main feature of our website. We designed a canvas that looks similar to a whiteboard with various color that users can pick from to draw with. We also have an undo, erase, and clear button so final touches can be added. Finally, there is a save button that converts their drawing into a png that they can upload. "
